#Project Management Notes:


Reaching the end of this coursework, we have drawn some conclusions based on the overall progress we made since beginning on the 31st of January till the end of March.

Conclusion Outcomes:

1) We believe that we managed our time wisely by starting early, since it gave us the chance to make mistakes and have enough time to correct them.
This can be seen from the Actual Effort and Estimated Effort logs. It can be seen in many occasions that the Actual Effort was greater than the Estimated one.

2) Due to lack of confidence in using a fully Object Oriented Programming approach, many of the methods used to implement the compiler are redundant. For example if inheritance 
was used appropriately, the total number of classes of the Abstract Syntax Tree would be much lower, and much less time would be needed to accomplish a single task (in terms of coding it).

3) The approach used for traversing the AST tree, and the way it was built, allowed for a better gathering of information. For example all of the expressions
could have been merged into one class called BinaryOperations. This would require knowing what the operation being carried out would be. Having a separate class for each Binary operation
does not require any further information gathering. This idea was carried throughout the whole completion of the deliverable. The reason was that we couldn't predict any complications we would have if we made any simplification design choices, so we decided to stick to the "safe" way, even though that meant more time coding/typing.
