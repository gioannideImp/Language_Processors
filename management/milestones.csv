MakeAPlan,None,2,gi316,5e05c8b5adb177b6a207381dccbcd25a0a25bfc5,Make an estimated plan of how the workload will be spread across the allowed timeframe
BasicCLexer,LexingLab,6,gi316,5e05c8b5adb177b6a207381dccbcd25a0a25bfc5,Create a Basic C Lexer that can identify most of the trivial tokens in the C language
CompleteTheCLexer,BasicCLexer,8,ap4116,f355062ec5b9fd148505be3b9e902a21f8b013d3,The Lexer can identify complex regular expressions and can successfully read and tokenize provided C source codes
BasicCParser,ParsingLab,3,gi316,64964bea93c74708217064ca007c718ce1a192c1,The Parser can parse trivial expressions/statements and most importantly have a working communication between Bison and Flex
TestBasicCParser,BasicCParser,8,ap4116,59b0bfd6f1749c6837ea81f614d7eda96d306949,Be able to group tokens that are syntactically legal and parse an Abstract Syntax Tree
CompleteCParser,TestBasicCparser,7,ap4116,a43e3e757f71cdf199f92ae3539b5fa540d940b2,Be confident that the C parser is at the required final level of required complexity. Test it extensively to see what has been achieved
LearnBasicPython,None,5,ap4116,88816aa3f3b8e084e6f315ea5787b28a9101004a,Need to learn basic Python syntax in order to be able to write a C to Python Translator
ConstructCtoPythonTranslator,CompletedCParser,8,ap4116,64964bea93c74708217064ca007c718ce1a192c1,"Using the Lexer and the Parser implemented, create an Abstract Syntax Tree to Python from C"
TestCtoPythonParser,ConstructedCtoPythonParser,8,gi316,59b0bfd6f1749c6837ea81f614d7eda96d306949,Test C to python Translator
StartCodeGen,CompletedCodeGenLab,6,gi316,e19a8b7f4f75cc816b67328eaaaad57b0f7846cc,"Using principles learned from the CodeGen lab, structure the implementation of the Abstract Syntax Tree to MIPS I assembly"
AbasicCodegenVersion,StartedCodeGen,8,ap4116,e19a8b7f4f75cc816b67328eaaaad57b0f7846cc,The CodeGen at least works for all of the basic cases and hopefully even more
A_workingCodegen,AbasicCodegenVersion,8,gi316,7c966c8935e6a212e3d804590b0bf400eb9baca7,Verify the CodeGen works for most of the cases and hopefully (near) all
TestBenchDesign,WorkingCompilerAndCodeGen,8,ap4116,,Make up a formal TestBench to test extensively the Compiler and Translator
WriteTheReport,AllOfTheAbove,8,gi316,,Finish writing the report/documentation
